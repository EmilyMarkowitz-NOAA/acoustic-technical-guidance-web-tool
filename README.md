> Code was developed as part of my 2018 John A. Knauss Marine Policy Sea Grant Fellowship. Fellowship was working in the NMFS Office of Science and Technology's Assessment and Monitoring Group's Protected Species Science Branch. This application was designed and created for the NMFS Office of Protected Resources. 


## Introduction

NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) recognizes that the permanent threshold shift (PTS) onset thresholds and marine mammal auditory weighting functions provided in the 2018 Revised Technical Guidance for Assessing the Effects of Anthropogenic Sound on Marine Mammal Hearing are more complex than NMFS' previous thresholds and that different action proponents may have different levels of modeling capabilities. Thus, NMFS has provided a companion optional Web Calculator tool for those action proponents unable to implement the 2018 Revised Technical Guidance's thresholds in the weighted cumulative sound exposure level (SELcum) and peak sound pressure (PK) level metrics and the associated marine mammal auditory weighting functions.

There is no obligation to use the optional Web Calculator tool. The use of more sophisticated exposure modeling or consideration of additional activity‐, source-, or location‐specific factors, if possible, is encouraged.

# Using the Optional Web Calculator Tool

The optional Web Calculator Tool consists of four main Tabs provided as a ribbon at the top of this and all tabs:

**Introduction:** Current Tab that provides a general introduction to the optional Web Calculator tool

**Optional Calculator:** Tab where action proponent enters project and source information to compute threshold isopleths (meters)

**Weight Factor Adjustments (WFA):** Tab that provides more information on using Weighting Factor Adjustments (WFA) used to incorporate weighting functions* in to isopleth calculations.

**Glossary and Literature Cited:** Tab that provides a list of abbreviations and glossary terms found in the optional Web Calculator Tool. It also provides a list of literature cited.
